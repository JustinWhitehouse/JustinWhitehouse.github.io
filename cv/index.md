### Width scaling of an interface constrained by a membrane  
**Physical Review Letters (Editor’s Suggestion)** | *Aug 2018*  
_Co‑developed analytics, wrote Java simulation code, and built Python/Bash data‑processing pipeline._

In this paper we investigated the stochastic dynamics of a growing interface in the presence of an impenetrable moving membrane, which was designed as a simple model for movement in certain types of biological cells. I helped develop the analytics that describe some properties of the model. I also wrote the Java code that was used to perform Monte Carlo simulations, and the python and bash scripts that were used to perform data processing and analysis. I helped to prepare the paper for scientific publication.

### Maintenance of order in a moving strong condensate  
**Journal of Statistical Mechanics** | *Nov 2014*  
_Developed Java simulation code, Python/Bash analysis scripts, and mathematical theory explaining phase transition._

In this paper we investigated the dynamics of a stochastic model of non-equilibrium mass transport, of the kind which are crucial for understanding, for example, biochemical processes which occur in living cells. I developed Java code to perform numerical simulations, and used python and bash scripts to process the data. I also helped develop a mathematical theory which explains the nature of a phase transition which occurs in this system, and drafted the paper for scientific publication.

### Effect of partial absorption on diffusion with resetting  
**Physical Review E** | *Feb 2013*  
_Derived analytical results for mean time to absorption in diffusion‑with‑resetting model._

In this paper I studied a model strategy for searching and locating a target, which involves undergoing diffusion and then resetting one's position to some location to try again, as an improvement on a purely diffusion based search strategy. I derived mathematical formulae for the Mean Time to Absorption of the searcher by the target, and other quantities of interest, in the case where the target has some probability of being receptive to the searcher.

### PhD, Statistical Physics  
**University of Edinburgh** | *2011 – 2015*  
**Thesis:** *Stochasticity and Fluctuations in Non‑equilibrium Transport Models*

I created and analysed models of stochastic processes using mathematical tools, such as stochastic master equations, and Monte Carlo simulations. Understanding these is important for gaining insight into a wide array of mass transport phenomena which are out of equilibrium. This field of research is particularly useful for understanding complex biochemical processes in cells, which are inherently out of equilibrium.
